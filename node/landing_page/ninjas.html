           <p>Because of the secrecy that surrounded them for centuries, (Chinese) ninjas and (Japanese) shinobi are romanticized in fiction and theater, and their role and skills are greatly exaggerated and excessive.

           The whole story is escalated when the ninjas arrived on the big screen, where they appear as a superior invisible warriors who had no trouble moving underground, run on water ... and fly.

           Well, today we know that the modern view of ninjas mainly based on a romanticized version of the drama. Simply to say that all the ninjas were extremely capable fighters and assassins would be as say that all of today's intelligence agents and spies capable as James Bond.

           Unlike samurai, ninjas nobody loved or respected (except jonins, masters and supreme commanders). The ninjas were doing jobs that nobody else wanted to do. Killing people ambushed was considered dishonorable in Japan and ninjas are often treated as a necessary evil.</p>

            <h2>Who was the first ninja warrior?</h2>
            <p> Like any ancient skills, and one that are ninjas adopted is full of myths and legends. But careful monitoring history, historians have concluded that the original source of the skills and philosophy that were later adopted by ninjas in Japan comes from India where it all began 6000 years ago. Philosophy and skills are slowly traveled from India to China, then to Korea and finally, in the 6th century came to Japan.

            According to the official history of Japan, the first ninjas was a man named Otomono Sahiti, a spy who worked for Prince Shotoku (574-622), but the term first became formal and 1162, when they met Daisuke Togakure, samurai who lost their possessions, and then gave up the Samurai bushido code and title and Kain Doshi, a Chinese warrior-smonk.

            Daisuke and Cain are merged their knowledge and experience under one name - Ninjutsu, which has become a set of different skills including martial arts, strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare, espionage, information gathering, coping and survival in nature, cloaking and stealth, camouflage, avoiding enemy infiltration, overcoming natural and man-made obstacles, fight with their bare hands, different weapons.

            Ninjutsu is soon to become the exact opposite of bushido, the code of the samurai. While the samurai were primarily valued loyalty and honor, ninjas code has valued the only accomplishment of the mission - at any cost.</p>
